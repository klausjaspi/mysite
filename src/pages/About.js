                            <h4>Python</h4>

                            <p>The first programming language I learned. During my first year of studies I learned the basics of Python and did some basic functions.{"\n"}On the first semester of second year studies I learned Python back-end programming. Course application was done in virtual machine with pgAdmin 4, Flask, and Postman.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Java</h4>
                            <p>I learned Java on my spare time along with my second semester first year studies. I needed to learn it in short period to develop an android based application with my team members during product development course. My role was to be the chairman{"\n"}Our team succeeded to develop an Android based attendance application which accomplished a shared first place as the best product in a competition within the course.{"\n"}Naturally, we were and still are very proud of this achievement. We used Java as programming language, Android Studio as development platform, and Google's Firebase as database.{"\n\n"}</p>
                            <p>In the summer of 2020 I continued to refine my skills on developing android application and programmed my own app, Frisbeeh.{"\n"}Goal was to learn more and refine my skills, this time on my own.{"\n\n"}In similar fashion I used Java, Android Studio, and Firebase database, but added new content such as working login & sign up options.{"\n\n"}</p>

                            <p>As a part of my studies, I got to learn Wordpress and Elementor by working with two other students on a commercial project.{"\n"}Project was done in theFIRMA, which is a learning environment in Turku University of Applied Sciences that operates like a real company.</p>
                            <p>{"\n"}I got valuable experience, not only on Wordpress and Elementor, but also on project management and how to carry out a commercial project.</p>

                            <h4>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h4>
                            <p>Before early fall of 2020 I had no experience on web development, only a deep drive to learn and master it.{"\n"}I watched many tutorials and along them began my trial & error type of learning process.{"\n"}I've grown very passionated about web development and will continue to refine my knowledge on it in future.{"\n\n"}</p>
